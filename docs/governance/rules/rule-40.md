  **Every Flyway migration that creates a table with a `tenant_id` column MUST enable Postgres Row-Level Security in the same migration (`ALTER TABLE <name> ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` plus per-tenant `CREATE POLICY`). Migrations predating this rule are listed in `gate/rls-baseline-grandfathered.txt` and MUST be retrofitted in W2.**
---

## Motivation

The L0 motivation (LucioIT W1 §7.2): application-layer tenant isolation is "insecure" — a single bypass (path traversal, ORM injection, broken filter) breaks every tenant. RLS at the storage engine ensures even a fully-compromised application tier cannot read across tenants.

## Cross-references

- Enforced by Gate Rule 50 (`rls_for_new_tenant_tables`) — scans every `agent-*/src/main/resources/db/migration/V*.sql` for tables with `tenant_id` and requires either matching `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` in the same file OR an entry in the grandfather list.
- Architecture reference: ADR-0069 / LucioIT W1 §7.2.
- Grandfather list: `gate/rls-baseline-grandfathered.txt` (V1/V2 migrations grandfathered).
- Grandfather retrofit deferred to W2 per `CLAUDE-deferred.md` 40.b.
- Companion rule: Rule 21 ([`rule-21.md`](rule-21.md)) — Tenant Propagation Purity (application-layer tenant identity discipline; RLS is the storage-layer defence-in-depth).
