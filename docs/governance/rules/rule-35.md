  **Cross-service internal communication MUST be sliced into three physically isolated channels declared in `docs/governance/bus-channels.yaml`: `control` (out-of-band, highest priority), `data` (in-band, heavy-load), and `rhythm` (heartbeat/liveness). No two channels may share a `physical_channel:` identifier. The `data` channel inherits the 16 KiB inline-payload cap from §4 #13.**

## Motivation

The L0 motivation (LucioIT W1 §6.4): any single network-congestion event must NOT cause global paralysis. A slow text-to-video transfer on `data` cannot block a `PAUSE` intent on `control`.

## Cross-references

- Enforced by Gate Rule 45 (`bus_channels_three_track_present`) — schema check on the YAML and uniqueness of `physical_channel`.
- Architecture reference: ADR-0069 / LucioIT W1 §6.4.
- Physical channel implementation deferred to W2 per `CLAUDE-deferred.md` 35.b.
